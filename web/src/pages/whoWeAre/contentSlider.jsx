                We are working on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
                automated platforms and An Application Tracking System (ATS)
                which is a powerful tool designed to streamline the recruitment
                process. By automating the organization, tracking, and
                evaluation of job applications, an ATS helps HR teams manage
                large volumes of applicants with ease. It provides a centralized
                platform where resumes are parsed, categorized, and matched
                against job requirements, ensuring that only the most qualified
                candidates move forward.
